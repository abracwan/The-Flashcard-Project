The Flashcard Project can be started without a card database by running this application (fp.exe). It opens to a blank card to edit. To begin making a new card deck, enter a question and answer and click Save. A new card database will be generated named “cards.db”. Otherwise, use the file menu to open an existing card database.

Additional cards can be added by clicking Add, entering or pasting in content, and clicking Save. Use File-Save-As to store the file with a different name.

The green arrow button displays the next card. Cards are displayed randomly by default. Use Setup to change this and view them sequentially.

When studying, formulate an answer before clicking Answer. If you do not want to see the card again, click Archive. Reset the deck using the Setup menu to see these cards again.

Share your cards by using the application to export them to a YAML file. The YAML file type is both human and machine readable. The person you share the cards with can import your YAML file to a blank card deck. They can also import them to another card file and save the cards as a consolidated deck.

The Flashcard Project simplifies making, managing, and studying flashcards on a desktop. The size-adjustable frame makes it easy to have other applications and study references displayed. This can be useful when studying a computer language so you can switch to a code editor or interpreter for testing and practice.

While other flashcard applications provide extended features, The Flashcard Project offers a simple system that allows content sharing and merging. The files can be shared for use by anyone with the software. Cards can be categorized with tags and you can save your card decks.

You can…

•	Edit cards on the same screen as they are displayed.

•	Save card decks to a database file.

•	Export files in machine and human-readable formats.

•	Merge card decks.

•	Tag cards to allow filtering.

•	Delete unwanted tags simultaneously from all cards.

•	Display cards randomly or sequentially.

•	Flag cards as archived so they will not be shown.

•	Reset the deck so all archived and excluded cards are shown.


Use this to help with learning for any subject. If you are an instructor, your students could be tasked with producing their own flashcards and submit them as card files. Their cards can be easily consolidated into a single card deck that is useful to all of your students. 

The Flashcard Project is free and open source software written in Python. It can be used, redistributed, and modified it under the terms of its MIT license.
